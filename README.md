# Cherrystone

![](images/logo-wide.png)


Cherrystone is a DSL for defining CRUD resources in an opinionated way. It
acts as an additional layer between the structure of your resources
and the actual rendering - the latter not being part of cherrystone.

This enforces a boundary - resource definitions without dependencies to
an actual UI implementation/framework.

This makes it a perfect candidate for usage within a component based
app architecture - components can define controllers and UIs and let
the main app decide about implementation details.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cherrystone'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cherrystone
